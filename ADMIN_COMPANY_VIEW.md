# ✅ Admin Company Data View

## What's New

When logged in as **admin**, you can now see:
- **All companies' data** (not filtered by company)
- **Company badges** showing which company each data item belongs to

## How It Works

### Admin View
- **Dashboard**: Shows all strategic areas, risks, and data from all companies
- **SP Management**: Shows all SP items from all companies
- **Company Badges**: Each item displays a colored badge showing its company:
  - 🔵 **TechCorp A** (blue badge)
  - 🟢 **Manufacturing B** (green badge)

### Regular User View
- **Filtered Data**: Only sees data from their own company
- **No Company Badges**: Company info is hidden (they only see their own data)

## Test It

1. **Login as Admin**:
   - `ahmet@companya.com` / `admin123` (Company A Admin)
   - `mehmet@companyb.com` / `admin123` (Company B Admin)

2. **Check Dashboard**:
   - You should see strategic areas from BOTH companies
   - Each area shows a company badge

3. **Check SP Management**:
   - Go to "SP Yönetimi"
   - You should see items from BOTH companies
   - Each item has a "Şirket" column with company badge

## Company Badges

- **TechCorp A**: Blue badge
- **Manufacturing B**: Green badge

Badges appear next to:
- Strategic Areas
- Strategic Objectives
- Targets
- Indicators
- Activities
- Risks

**✅ Admins can now see which company provides each data item!**
